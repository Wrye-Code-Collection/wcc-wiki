<h1 id="s_1-1">Current Wrye Bash Features</h1>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Move a file higher or lower in the list of installers to overwrite files. Because uninstalling files and overwriting files in a certain order is difficult and can easily be done wrong. Which means you have to start over. Not to mention that it is easier to know where to drag the file and which files need to be overwritten when you can visually see conflicting files.</li>
        <li>See at a glance from the list of installers (colored indicator or icon) when files from the archive differ from the files in the data folder</li>
        <li>Manual way to refresh the CRC tracking of files in the Data folder, installer folders, and archives</li>
        <li>Tracking mod to monitor an external installation (EXE installer or manual install) when finished all new files tracked are converted into an archive or organized into a folder for installation. Eliminating the need for the external installer.</li>
        <li>Report of all installed plugin files (copied to clipboard)</li>
        <li>Localization via Poedit</li>
        <li>Report of all installed mods downloaded from the nexus (name of the mod installed - copied to clipboard)</li>
        <li>Add my own custom categories I can use to organize my mods</li>
        <li>Double click the mod to view the archive's contents.</li>
        <li>Open the location of the archive or folder in the windows explorer</li>
        <li>Unpack the archive into a folder and install the files from the folder instead (without closing the mod manager)</li>
        <li>Rename or Delete the archive or folder</li>
        <li>Display a list of all the files (from the installer folder or archive) with their directories that I can cut and paste anywhere I may need (copy to clipboard)</li>
        <li>Suggested options offered to skip certain file types (readme files for example)</li>
        <li>Track orphan files in the data folder but not part of an installer (the ck built a new face gen file or topic info file)</li>
        <li>Synchronize changed files from the Data folder to an installer folder and the reverse. (From and installer to the Data folder)</li>
        <li>Tabs or some way to see at a glance</li>
        <ul>
            <li>all the files in the archive</li>
            <li>which files match what is in the data folder and the archive or folder</li>
            <li>which files are missing (I didn't skip them)</li>
            <li>which files are not the same in the data folder and the archive or folder (I edited the plugin in the CK so it changed or the CK compiled a script)</li>
            <li>a list of all files with the same name and extension (they will conflict) from any folder, archive, or BSA/BA2 file</li>
            <li>any skipped files</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A way to install files by</li>
        <ul>
            <li>folder - no script - (00 Main, 01 Textures, 02 Alt Textures, 03 Body Slide, 04 Script Extender Plugins)</li>

        <li>Ways to link to programs I find useful for modding such as LOOT, xEdit, NifSkope, Photoshop, Blender (create custom links as well as default options)</li>
        <li>A watchdog of sorts (not necessarily a DLL of the same name) that will notice when a file is added or removed from in the data folder and updates my list of plugins. The routine wouldn't auto activate the mod but would cleanse my load order</li>
        <ul>
            <li>alters plugins.txt or loadorder.txt when applicable</li>
            <li>loadorder.txt not used by Fallout 4 and future games with star load order</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If a mod author or user changes the ESM flag (of an ESP file) of a plugin the mod manager automatically moves the plugin into the ESM group above all the ESP files and alters load order files</li>
        <li>An option to flag files with the ESL flag for games that support ESL files.</li>
        <li>Enable and manage ESL flagged files.</li>

        <li>A way to see the save game and which files were installed at the time the save game was made</li>
        <li>A way to build a report of which mods were used in the save game (copy to clipboard)</li>
        <li>A way to make different folders for my save games (set SLocalSavePath in game's INI to avoid copying files)</li>
        <li>Copy save games to other folders I have created (Other play through)</li>
        <li>Colored indicators to show</li>
        <ul>

            <li>present but at a different location</li>
            <li>missing from my load order</li>
            <li>separate color to show all files are present and have the exact same load order as the save game's header</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A report that shows mods that have been added or removed from my load order compared to the save game's header</li>

        <li>Display the screen shot from the save game header so I know how I want to organize the file</li>
        <li>A way to alter the INI files with commonly suggested settings that I can check and uncheck to apply them without knowing where the files are located on my HD</li>
        <li>A way to restore the default INI files</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Download the file form the nexus by clicking on the webpage</li>
        <li>Organize mods by pre-determined categories like those used on the Nexus. Hide empty categories to avoid clutter.</li>
        <li>Tell the mod manager what folder should be considered the Data folder (Where the plugin and resources are) Because I sometimes see archives with nested folders that I'm not interested in like "My Mod\it has a name\I want to have screen shots\then the plugin and other files"</li>
        <li>Option to remove superfluous folders previously mentioned but to the mod manager it's still considered the same file and same version I downloaded from the Nexus.</li>
        <li>A way to indicate which file and version it is if the information wasn't or isn't available to suppress warnings</li>
        <li>A way to specify any files I want to skip (not a pre-determined set or list, my choice) just anything I don't want (advanced users only)</li>
        <li>From Above: A way to install files by</li>
        <ul>
            <li>by OBMM</li>

        </ul>
        <li>A wysiwyg installer creator (BAT) that lets me</li>
        <ul>
            <li>create a complex install archive by specifying folders and dragging and dropping files</li>
            <li>a way to add pics and descriptions as needed</li>
            <li>Complex enough to cover any situation and provide one file for users to download</li>
            <li>A way to detect any plugin, texture, or file and only offer certain install options based on installed files (don't show a patch for Moda when it isn't installed)</li>
            <li>I don't want to manually edit an xml or script file I want it built for me</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A watchdog that sees I removed an installer (file or folder) but the files are in the data folder and removes the files. Only tracks files installed with the mod manager and any remaining files become orphaned files.</li>
        <li>Sort the mods (excluding missing mods) in the same order as indicated in the save game header. Remaining files append to end of the list.</li>
    </ul>
