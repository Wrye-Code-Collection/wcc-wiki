{{PAGETITLE="Skyrim Special Edition Tutorial Link Compendium"}}

= Intent ========================================================================================

. The **SSE TLC** is a comprehensive collection of tutorial links from all corners of the internet, sorted by subject, to help modders in developing new skillsets. It was felt that this material would be better found and utilized, especially by those with no technical background, by hosting a list of available links in one place. Many SSE tools are interconnected and users should have basic understanding in many to become proficient modders able to make their own stable playlists of mods, but sometimes lack even the basic knowledge to know what questions to ask. 

. Each tutorial is identified as being beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Following each tutorial title and link is brief informational content with the author's name, summary, format, and date of creation. Links to explicitly pay-to-access material are not currently listed, though several of the sites linked to offer subscriptions for reduced ads or host authors who have private Patreon accounts.

. Here is an explanation of the difficulty identifier icons utilized within the **TLC**:

* {{inline:20px | SqOC.png | OC}} "Official content". This material has been authored or authorized by the developer(s). Always read these first in any subject unit as the developers know their tools best. Other user videos will clarify or expand on this material.

* {{inline:20px | Sqbegin.png | B}} "Beginner" content. Most users will be able to understand this material without any prerequisites.

* {{inline:20px | Sqinter.png | I}} "Intermediate" content. Typically, new users will need to review and understand beginner content before attempting to master this material.

* {{inline:20px | Sqadvan.png | A}} "Advanced" content. Do not attempt to use material covered in these tutorials unless you have a broad, in-depth understanding of the tool you are attempting to use.

* {{inline:20px | Sqold.png | O}} "Older" content, typically anything before 2017. This doesn't necessarily mean the content is out of date, but just make sure you compare it to newer versions to see what has changed.

* {{inline:20px | Sqtool.png | T}} "Tool"; a tool download site, uploaded and maintained by the developer(s). 

* {{inline:20px | Sqdiscus.png | D}} "Discussion"; a forum discussion site or Discord server. These are typically built and maintained by the developer(s) of any specific tool.

* {{inline:20px | Sqguide.png | G}} "Guide"; curated mod collections.

This tutorial also covers an alternate, more manual method, if LOOT fails to sort the masters in the new version of the game.

I felt it was important to re-cover this topic after a lot of recent changes to the Creation Kit and due to a number of things that modders may run into later on down the line which can be tricky to fix. I cover the basic installation and also how to load multiple master files up in the kit, along with the official Skyrim DLCs. This is something that you cannot do by default and you need to make some small adjustments yourself. The other two topics covered in this video are the time stamps for DLC esm files and the fact that script compiling may not work unless you do some messing around in the Data folder.~~

Before you can reply you hear a voice in your head telling you to kill the beggar. Suddenly you pull out your ax and approach the beggar. With one slash the beggar collapses on the ground. The voice in your head congratulates you. When you regain control of your body you are standing over the corpse of the beggar with a bloodied ax in hand.~~

          * Format: __Text__ 
          * ~~"Archive.exe, the Alternative to Using the CK Archive Function: The CK auto-archiving function is geared toward uploading mods to Steam Workshop. There are issues with using it. It will not automatically gather up all the files that are needed to make a mod work. Careful thought and manual addition and subtraction of files are required to make it work. The interface may be hard to use for some people. The process often derails and you may have to go back to square one. There are reports that it just does not work on particular computers for unexplained reasons.~~
          * ~~There are issues with uploading mods to Steam Workshop. It seems that it will only accept mods that do not have .esm files, multiple .esp files, multiple text documents, or image files included. This means that many mods cannot be uploaded to Steam Workshop because of how the system is designed.~~
          * ~~So because of these issues, it is good to be able to package your files using a different program. Archive.exe will work even if the CK is just giving out error messages. Archive.exe can help you package any mod, no matter how complicated it is and no matter how many pieces it comes in. So you could use it to pack up mods to upload to Steam Workshop as well as mods to upload to various Skyrim mod sites."~~
