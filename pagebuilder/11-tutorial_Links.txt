          * This tutorial will cover the steps needed to sort out your load order, as well as your master file load order for the Creation Kit 64bit. By default, the masters are not in the correct order so you have to adjust it yourself. This can be done using a tool called LOOT which I'm sure many are already familiar with. This tutorial also covers an alternate, more manual method, if LOOT fails to sort the masters in the new version of the game. I will also be covering how to use xEDIT to make changes to existing esp files so that your masters are in the correct order.

          * Skyrim SE has brought the unfathomable power of mods to consoles, and players couldn't be more thrilled. However, many console players have extremely little experience (or none at all) when it comes to downloading mods.
          * This being the case, a plethora of players who are (relatively) new to downloading mods have encountered bugs, errors, glitches, and crashes that may be caused by a poor and unorganized mod load-order... and if you're reading this "how to" then there is a high likelihood that you are one of those players. BUT HAVE NO FEAR, in this thread I will be giving a quick explanation of what a load order is, how it works, and a general/optimal way to organize your load order.

          * <font class="blue"> ~~Intermediate~~ </font>  
          * Welcome to a new tutorial video for installing the Skyrim Creation Kit. I felt it was important to re-cover this topic after a lot of recent changes to the Creation Kit and due to a number of things that modders may run into later on down the line which can be tricky to fix. I cover the basic installation and also how to load multiple master files up in the kit, along with the official Skyrim DLCs. This is something that you cannot do by default and you need to make some small adjustments yourself. The other two topics covered in this video are the time stamps for DLC esm files and the fact that script compiling may not work unless you do some messing around in the Data folder.
