          * ~~Intermediate~~
          * This tutorial will cover the steps needed to sort out your load order, as well as your master file load order for the Creation Kit 64bit. By default, the masters are not in the correct order so you have to adjust it yourself. This can be done using a tool called LOOT which I'm sure many are already familiar with. This tutorial also covers an alternate, more manual method, if LOOT fails to sort the masters in the new version of the game. I will also be covering how to use xEDIT to make changes to existing esp files so that your masters are in the correct order.

          * ~~Intermediate~~
          * Skyrim SE has brought the unfathomable power of mods to consoles, and players couldn't be more thrilled. However, many console players have extremely little experience (or none at all) when it comes to downloading mods.
          * This being the case, a plethora of players who are (relatively) new to downloading mods have encountered bugs, errors, glitches, and crashes that may be caused by a poor and unorganized mod load-order... and if you're reading this "how to" then there is a high likelihood that you are one of those players. BUT HAVE NO FEAR, in this thread I will be giving a quick explanation of what a load order is, how it works, and a general/optimal way to organize your load order.

          * **Author:** Darkfox127
          * ~~Intermediate~~
          * Welcome to a new tutorial video for installing the Skyrim Creation Kit. I felt it was important to re-cover this topic after a lot of recent changes to the Creation Kit and due to a number of things that modders may run into later on down the line which can be tricky to fix. I cover the basic installation and also how to load multiple master files up in the kit, along with the official Skyrim DLCs. This is something that you cannot do by default and you need to make some small adjustments yourself. The other two topics covered in this video are the time stamps for DLC esm files and the fact that script compiling may not work unless you do some messing around in the Data folder.

I mention a few things which may help and I cover creating a manual bsa which has a number of advantages.

          * In this Skyrim Creation Kit tutorial we cover how to take control of the player's character with AI packages. Knowing this, you will be able to control the player just like you would any other actor. The scenario for this tutorial: While wandering through Whiterun you are approached by a beggar who asks you for gold. Before you can reply you hear a voice in your head telling you to kill the beggar. Suddenly you pull out your ax and approach the beggar. With one slash the beggar collapses on the ground. The voice in your head congratulates you. When you regain control of your body you are standing over the corpse of the beggar with a bloodied ax in hand.

          * ~~Advanced~~
          * There are times that we may want to dynamically attach scripts to objects and actors. This could be because we don't want to alter the vanilla records, or because we think it's going to be too much work to edit every single vanilla record, or because we want our mod to work on objects added by other mods.
There are many ways to do this, and this tutorial will only cover two of them. The first method is to attach magic effect scripts to actors, and the second is to attach reference alias scripts to objects.

          * ~~Currently there is a rare bug: if you already got audio files (with correct file paths, (read table in Edit Response" window)), but it does not work inside the Skyrim game (does not matter in Creation Kit, test just in the game itself), then you need to convert sound files from WAV to XWM, then XWM to FUZ, for more info and converter links visit [[http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1347 | This forum]] For some people it is the only way to make recorded tracks working in game."~~

You drink it (of course) and you soon learn that Balon has poisoned you. You will soon die if you do not get a hold of Balon's antidote. He will give it to you if you kill another man he poisoned.

          * In this Skyrim Creation Kit tutorial we cover how to create a quest that uses a few new features: custom AI procedures, changing an actor's race, and trigger regions. The story is: While adventuring outside of Whiterun, you encounter Balon Grey, who tells you he has lost his pet skeever. You tell him you'll help find the skeever and he gives you some cheese. You find the skeever in a nearby cabbage patch. Using the cheese, you lure the skeever back to Balon Grey. Then you learn something interesting about the skeever.

          * This tutorial covers how modders can use Papyrus more effectively by leveraging its inherent multithreading capability. This guide includes plenty of examples and explanations to help you understand the design pattern. Using multithreading can greatly increase the performance of mods that have many external function calls back-to-back (function A calls external function B, then calls external function C, then calls...) or deeply nested (function A calls external function B calls external function C calls...) and help execute time-critial tasks, at the cost of a short burst of resource utilization.

          * **Author:** Official CK Wiki Team
          * ~~Advanced~~
          * This tutorial demonstrates how to implement Linked lists in Papyrus.
          * Linked Lists are a powerful programming tool that can accomplish some tasks with ease that would otherwise be quite difficult. They are a bit like the linked references you see in the Creation Kit, but more versatile, as they can be dynamically created, used, and then deleted when they have served your purposes. Essentially, each element in a linked list has references to the Next reference, possibly the previous reference and often, as a timesaver, a reference to the first reference in the list.

          * **Author:** Official CK Wiki Team
          * ~~Advanced~~
          * Using Show - Message, it is possible to make an options menu with any number of buttons and/or levels. This is enabling as one can maintain but a single plugin with an options menu offering multiple configuration setting rather than necessitating multiple versions. In these examples, we'll use apparel items and a book, but a menu can be prompted and managed in a number of ways. First, create a message(s) form(s) and add/fill the buttons with the options you'd like to offer. Note that no more than ten buttons can be in a message box and that the button indices are offset by one such that the first option's index is 0 and not 1. If offering a lot of options, it's best to think ahead regarding how you want to organize your options, making the message forms first, then plugging them into the script.

          * Currently the tools used for modelling are not completely adapted for Skyrim, there are some steps that require some manual adjustments. This will surely change in the future months and this tutorial will be updated when required.

====  Packaging Mods for Upload

          * **Author:** Official CK Wiki Team
          * ~~Intermediate~~
          * "Archive.exe, the Alternative to Using the CK Archive Function: The CK auto-archiving function is geared toward uploading mods to Steam Workshop. There are issues with using it. It will not automatically gather up all the files that are needed to make a mod work. Careful thought and manual addition and subtraction of files are required to make it work. The interface may be hard to use for some people. The process often derails and you may have to go back to square one. There are reports that it just does not work on particular computers for unexplained reasons.
          * There are issues with uploading mods to Steam Workshop. It seems that it will only accept mods that do not have .esm files, multiple .esp files, multiple text documents, or image files included. This means that many mods cannot be uploaded to Steam Workshop because of how the system is designed.
          * So because of these issues, it is good to be able to package your files using a different program. Archive.exe will work even if the CK is just giving out error messages. Archive.exe can help you package any mod, no matter how complicated it is and no matter how many pieces it comes in. So you could use it to pack up mods to upload to Steam Workshop as well as mods to upload to various Skyrim mod sites."

          * ~~Intermediate~~
          * This mini guide will show you how to use Texture Sets for Skyrim. They are a very useful tool for retexturing meshes (clothing, armours, weapons, bodies, etc) without having to duplicate the mesh files.
          * In this guide I am going to add a new recolour for an armour, but if you want to retexture another item (like a weapon), it works exactly the same.
