          * ~~Intermediate~~
          * In this video I'll be covering how to create your own harvestable items in the Creation Kit. The example I will be using is taking a Blary resource jar and having it filled with ingredients which then disappear as they are taken from the Jar. To achieve this, we need to use Nifskope to make some changes to our jar mesh. You have to attach some nodes and make copies of some NiTriShapes which is actually fairly easy to do. You then import your mesh into the kit and set some basic harvest item options up.

          * ~~GUIDE~~
          * Skyrim Roleplay Enhancement Mod Guide. Patches and files needed for the guide will be available here on the Nexus.
          * SkyRem Concept: Add to the Skyrim experience by incorporating elements of strategic roleplay that focus on character creation, growth, and development that works seamlessly with the base (vanilla) game. While this began with the desire to tweak character creation, it has since grown into two (currently) series of mods and now a guide as I work to put it all together.
